       - While I was announcer KodaiFm gave us a team opportunity to search the local people's folk songs; That experience was an amazing experience; That way we collect folk song people around VarusaNadu / Vaigai River; Those collections are released by kodai FM by the name "Mullaiyatrora Ganam - FOLK SONGS OF MULLAI RIVER". I took a key role to collect those songs. Those collections are kept in AIR-Archive list.
